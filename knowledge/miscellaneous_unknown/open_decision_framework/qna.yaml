      The Open Decision Framework is a flexible, open approach to making
      decisions and leading projects. The Open Decision Framework was
      developed between 2009-2010 by Red Hat People team based on research by
      Duke Universityâ€™s Fuqua School of Business, Diana Martin, and additional
      community resources. The Open Decision Framework was created to drive
      better alignment between business decisions and the company strategy,
      goals, culture, values, and mission. It would demonstrate "what good looks
      like" in decision-making and communication. It would offer consistent
      guidance for teams and leaders on Red Hat cultural expectations, balancing
      transparency and confidentiality. Further it would improve associate
      engagement, signal-to-noise ratio on the internal mailing list. It was
      released on GitHub in 2016 using Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike
